# Sample-Scripts
A repo to store some sample scripts.

I am using this repo to store sample scripts, tests, config files and more; since I keep switching my linux distro.

* `thrust-samples`: While adding complex support, I wanted to test compatibility of `thrust::op` functions with complex types (`std::op` ops don't support thrust complex types).
    * `sample.cu`: contains test code to apply `thrust::acosh` on a complex tensor.
* `CPP`: This folder contains some important design patterns and new C++ features & their examples. For now, it just contains an example script to demonstrate use of variadic templates (highly inspired/referenced from CPP-Weekly: I didn't code it, but I did understand it ;)).

P.S; This repo is just for my reference.
